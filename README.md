# Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-EDA
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. By using machine learning techniques, this project explores relationships between patient attributes (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) and the presence of heart disease, then builds a predictive model to assist in early risk detection.
